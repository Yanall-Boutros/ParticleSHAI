number of jets couted in an event
pt of jet 1-4 ordered by pt
6 histoggrams with m_ij -- pairwise combinations
while plotting number of jets also plot number of muons / elecrrons separately
sfso
osof
all tranvserse/normal energies of jets
jets 1-6 and 1-4 have 0 values if no jet
Make ROC curve of tt eff vs zz rej (back)
