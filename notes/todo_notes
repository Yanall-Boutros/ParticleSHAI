plot input variables for different events
could be isolating pt
jet eta
jet mass
do pt jet for all of them
then in an individual event try leading three
put in number of jets per event
multijet background -- just being produced in some big splurge of jets
Add some variables that give hints about resonant structure
sum of jet masses produced = particle mass
pair by pair mass of two jets
Use Truth Record
loop through every pair of jets, 4 choose 2.
cmnd file to make multi jet signal backgroud.
