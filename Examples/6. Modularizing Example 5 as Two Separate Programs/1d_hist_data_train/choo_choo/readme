Description of files and their contents
##################################################################################
control            - control is a file which encodes a numpy value of 1 or 0. if
                     the value of control is 1, training is permitted and the 
                     python programs will continue to generate data and train off
                     that data until control is set to 0.

halt_training.py   - a simply python file that writes a value of 0 to
                     the control file

permit_training.py - a similar python file to halt_traininy.py, which
                     sets a value of 1 to the control file

status.py          - when executed, status.py will print to stdout (i.e you)
                     the current value stored in the control file

data.py            - if control is set to 1, data.py will generate packages of
                     particle simulation data for network.py to train from

network.py         - if control is set to 1, network.py will wait for carepackages
                     to be generated, load the data, train the networks, then repeat
                     until control is set to 0

zz.cmnd            - cmnd file containing parameter configurations to simulate events
                     in a particle collider which result in zz bosons being generated
                     as the parent particle in the decay processes

ttbar.cmnd         - cmnd file containg parameter configurations to simulate events
                     in a particle collider which result in top anti top quark pairs
                     to be generated as parent particles in the collider
